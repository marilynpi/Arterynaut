Arterynaut
==========

Shoot 'em up game made with CreateJS for the Global GameJam 2013

History
----------
You are the sheriff of the veins and blood vessels of a person. Your duty is to help its heart. 

Gameplay
----------
Use the arrow keys or WASD to move around and configure your bazooka. Use J to shoot white blood cells and kill bacterias and K to shoot red blood cells and grab oxygen. When bacteria hit a vein wall they weaken, use L to shoot platelet and prevent them from breaking. If you do this right, oxygen and health bars will maintain steady and you will help the heart. Good luck!
